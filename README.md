INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
--------------------

AIM:
----
This project aims to demonstrate the working principle of inventory management in the daily operations of various business organisations in the world today.


ABSTRACT:
---------
Inventory refers to things such as raw materials procured for production, and the finished goods that a company sells in the market. Inventory management is the process of maintaining the right level of stocks for all the raw materials, unfinished and finished products. The core objective of inventory management is to ensure proper levels of supply. The story of inventory is maintained at all time to ensure that the required level of demand is met, and loss from theft, spoilage, and returns are prevented, and better customer satisfaction is maintained. The warehouse of a company is the central entity in the inventory management because all the process happens here in an organisation.

The RDBMS that will be used for this is MySQL, and the commands that would be demonstrated extensively are 'create', 'insert', 'select', 'update', and 'delete'.
