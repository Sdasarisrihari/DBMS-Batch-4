INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
--------------------

AIM:
----
This project aims to demonstrate the working principle of inventory management in the daily operations of various business organisations in the world today.


ABSTRACT:
---------
When we talk about the inventory management system in business organisations in general, the main parties come into our mind- seller, customer and the warehouse. The basic idea is that any business organisation would manufacture their goods and store them at a specific warehouse, and we refer to these goods as inventory. When sellers place bulk orders with the company, these goods are delivered to them, and they, in turn, sell it to the customers.  In this whole process, the company, with the help of predictive analytics, predicts the level of production so that inventory doesn't pile up in their warehouses. They also use ERP software to keep track of both manufacturing and supply chain.

The RDBMS that will be used for this is MySQL, and the commands that would be demonstrated extensively are 'create', 'insert', 'select', 'update', and 'delete'.
